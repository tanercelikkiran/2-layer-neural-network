# 2 Layer Neural Network

## Description

This is a simple 2 layer neural network that I wrote in Python for the final assignment of my BBM101 Introduction to Programming course. It is a simple neural network that can be used for distinguishing images. In the code, I used it to distinguish between cat and non-cat images. It can be used for other classification problems as well if the data is prepared accordingly. The main purpose of this code is to show how a neural network works and how to use advanced external libraries in Python such as Numpy and Matplotlib etc.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Jupyter Notebook

or any other Python IDE with the following libraries:

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- h5py
- PIL
- scipy

## Usage

- Clone the repository (<https://github.com/tanercelikkiran/2-layer-neural-network.git>) or download the zip file
- Open the Jupyter Notebook file in Jupyter Notebook
- Run the code cells in order
